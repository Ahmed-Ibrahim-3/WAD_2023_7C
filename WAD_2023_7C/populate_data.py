        'instructions': 'Heat a frying pan over a high heat. Drizzle 4 tbsp of the oil over the slices of aubergine and fry them in several batches for 5-7 mins or until golden brown and beginning to soften. If they look a little dry during cooking, add a dash more olive oil. Set aside on a plate lined with kitchen paper. Heat 1 tbsp of the oil in a large flameproof casserole dish or saucepan over a medium-high heat. Add the mince and fry for 8-10 mins until a deep golden brown, regularly stirring and breaking up with a wooden spoon. Tip into a bowl and set aside. Add the remaining oil to the casserole. Tip in the onion along with a pinch of salt and fry gently for 10-12 mins or until softened and turning translucent. Add the garlic, oregano, cinnamon, chilli and bay cooking for a further min. Return the lamb to the pan and pour in the red wine, bring to a bubble and reduce the wine by half. Stir through the tomatoes, tomato purée and brown sugar, along with 200ml water. Season. Lower the heat and simmer gently, uncovered, for 20 mins, stirring occasionally until the sauce has thickened. Heat oven to 200C/180 fan/gas 4. Bring a large pan of lightly salted water to the boil. Add the potato slices and cook for 6 mins, drain in a colander and leave to steam dry for 10 mins. Melt the butter in a small saucepan, stir in the flour and cook over a medium heat for 1 min. Remove from the heat and whisk in the milk, pouring in a bit at a time, until smooth. Return to the heat and bring to a simmer, cooking for 3 mins. Remove from the heat and whisk through the parmesan, a little grated nutmeg and some seasoning, and finally the whole egg as well as the yolk. Take a large rectangular ovenproof dish. Spoon a third of the meat into the dish and spread out evenly, followed by half the aubergine and half the potato, then the rest of the meat and another layer of aubergines, followed by potatoes. Finish with the béchamel, smoothing the top over with a palette knife. Put in the centre of the oven and cook for 50 mins or until deep golden brown. If it browns too much during cooking, cover the dish. Set aside for 10 mins to cool before serving.',

Alternatively, cover the bowl loosely with cling film and put in the microwave for 2 minutes on High. Leave the melted mixture to cool to room temperature. While you wait for the chocolate to cool, position a shelf in the middle of your oven and turn the oven on to 180C/160C fan/gas 4.

        'ingredients': '5 ounces of chopped chocolate, 6 tbsp butter, 2 eggs, 1 cup sugar, 1 tsp vanilla extract, 1/2 tsp salt, 3/2 cups of blueberries',
        'instructions': 'Preheat the oven to 400 (F). Prepare an 8 by 8-inch baking pan by lining with parchment paper or foil, leaving an overhang over each end. In a double boiler (or, a heatproof bowl set over a pot of gently simmering water), combine 5 ounces finely chopped bittersweet chocolate and 6 tablespoons unsalted butter. Melt over medium-low heat, using a heatproof rubber spatula to stir occasionally until the mixture is melted and smooth. Once the chocolate and butter have completely melted, remove from heat and allow to cool slightly on a wire rack. In the bowl of a freestanding electric mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, combine 2 large eggs and 1 cup granulated sugar. Beat on medium-high speed until light and fluffy, about 5 minutes. Lower the speed to the mixers lowest setting and add 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract. Continue mixing on the lowest speed and slowly add the cooled melted butter and chocolate mixture (from the 2nd step) into the mixture, mixing until just combined and the batter is a uniform chocolate color. Once the batter is a uniform chocolate color, sprinkle 3/4 cup all-purpose flour and 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt over the surface of the batter. Use a rubber spatula to gently fold the flour into the chocolate batter — DO NOT OVERMIX. Overmixing will lead to dense, hard brownies and me crying tears of sadness. Simply fold until the ingredients are just combined — at this point, it is okay to have one or two flour streaks left in the mixture.',

Knock back the dough by tipping it back onto a floured surface and pushing the air out. Mould the dough into a rugby ball shape that will fit a 900g loaf tin and place in the tin. Cover with a clean tea towel and leave to prove for 30 mins. Dust the top of the loaf with a little more flour and slash the top with a sharp knife if you want.

Stir into the flour to make a slightly sticky dough. If you need to add more water, splash it in 1 tbsp at a time. Knead the dough on a lightly floured surface for 10 mins (or in a tabletop mixer for 5-7 mins). Your dough should be smooth and elastic when it’s ready. Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl, flip the dough over to coat it in oil, then cover with a sheet of oiled cling film. Leave in a warm place until doubled in size – this will take about 1 hr (see note, below). Lightly oil a 900g loaf tin. Once doubled in size, knead the dough again for 3-5 mins to knock out the air bubbles – add most of the seeds and work these into the dough as you knead. Shape the dough into an oval roughly the same length as your tin. Place in the tin and leave to prove, covered with oiled cling film, for 30-45 mins until it has nearly doubled in size again. Heat oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6. Gently press a finger into the loaf to check if it has had enough proving time (see tip). When it’s ready, glaze the top of the loaf with the egg yolk and sprinkle over the remaining seeds. Bake in the oven for 40-45 mins until golden brown – if you tip the loaf out of the tin and tap the bottom, it should sound hollow. Leave to cool on a wire rack for at least 30 mins before slicing.',
